    question: "Is Breeja custodial?",
    answer:
      "Yes, and we say this plainly: v1 is a custodial fast-bridge. A single permissioned relayer controls the DestPool funds and decides when to release them, so you're trusting the relayer's key and liquidity, not a trustless cross-chain message protocol. That's exactly how early versions of Across Protocol and Hop worked — a legitimate, well-understood MVP pattern, not a shortcut we're hiding. v2 decentralizes release via a bonded watcher/attestation network — see the Roadmap.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this gasless?",
    answer:
      "The payer signs a free, off-chain permit (EIP-3009 style) naming a recipient — no transaction, no gas. The relayer submits the deposit on Sepolia and the release on the destination chain, paying gas on both sides, and recoups that cost via a small fee. Neither side ever needs to hold a gas token.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an agent use Breeja without a human in the loop?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The same POST /pay API that the web app calls can be called directly by any script or agent, no browser needed. Recipient is a separate parameter from payer, so agent-to-agent payments are a first-class case, not a workaround bolted onto a human-first flow.",
  },
  {
    question: "What networks does this support today?",
    answer:
      "Ethereum Sepolia as the source chain and HSK Chain Testnet as the destination, today, testnet only. More EVM chains are planned as part of the roadmap.",
